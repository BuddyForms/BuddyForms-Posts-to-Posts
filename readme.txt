The Plugin creates a new form element "posts-to-posts" with 2 options for your BuddyForms FormBuilder.

from: post, page or any post type<br>
to: post, page, user, any post type


<h4>Add Additional Parameter</h4>

Before the connection gets registered with p2p_register_connection_type($args) you can manipulate the $args with a filter.

$args = array(<br>
    'name'  => $field['slug'],<br>
    'from'  => $field['posts_to_posts_from'],<br>
    'to'    => $field['posts_to_posts_to']<br>
);<br>
$args  = apply_filters('connection_types_args', $args, $buddyform['slug']);<br>

There is documentation available for the Posts 2 Posts Plugin and all the available parameter.
